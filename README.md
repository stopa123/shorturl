This project is inspired by Tiny-URL which is used to convert a long URL to a short URL. Both the short and long URLs are stored in a MYSQL Database.

When the long URL is provided, the POST function will create a short URL, store it into the Database and and send the user an email of the short URL.
The GET and DELETE functions work retrieve and delete Database data respectively.

The Email functions is also used for troubleshooting as all errors generated by the functions are sent to the administrator.
